# DegeneracyHunter.jl

Creating good optimization models is difficult. Degeneracy Hunter is a collection of utilities to help JuMP/Julia model development. Key features include:
* Initial point analysis: display uninitialized variables and values violating bounds 
* Print infeasible constraint residuals
* Print inactive inequality constraints
* Determine Irreducible Set of Infeasible Equations (original *Degeneracy Hunter*)
